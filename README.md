## How it works
> To be honest this working reminds me of the interstellar lol

We encode the message into binary and then encode it into the lsb of the images pixel values. 
We only alter it by Â±1 though otherwise the changes to the color are noticeable.
For decoding the length is stored in the first 32 bits and its just simple decryption password based is a very simple xor encryption.

RGBA - Traditionally one might use RGB and encode values but it would cause changes to alpha channel which govern transparency and would be noticeable with backgroundless images so we use rgba instead.
